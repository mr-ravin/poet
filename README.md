      <b>Not A Play</b><br/>
      by <a href="https://mr-ravin.github.io" target="__blank__">Ravin Kumar</a><br/><br/>
      <p>
      Being a being is not a play,<br/>
      to all the beings shall I say.<br/>
      Things we do merely matter,<br/>
      when compared to the world's setter.<br/>
      Don't just play the part O fellow being,<br/>
      when you can choose and can think.<br/>
      Being a being is not a play,<br/>
      for those who think and then say.

      <p>
      To be the spell caster,<br/>
      to be the new master.<br/>
      Don't do the work hard,<br/>
      do work that is harder.<br/>
      Skilled and smarter,<br/>
      says, crafter turned master.<br/>
      Don't do the work hard,<br/>
      do work that is harder.

      <b>The devil's rule</b><br/>
      by <a href="https://mr-ravin.github.io" target="__blank__">Ravin Kumar</a><br/><br/>
      <p>
      Honest ones are call fool,<br/>
      Often happens when the devil rule.<br/>
      Unemployment and, people cry,<br/>
      honest ones are thinking why.<br/>
      News speakers start spreading the lie,<br/>
      Even the Gods do then say goodbye.<br/>
      People waiting for the honest's rule,<br/>
      Often happens when the devil rule.

      <b>A Journey</b><br/>
      by <a href="https://mr-ravin.github.io" target="__blank__">Ravin Kumar</a><br/><br/>
      <p>
      With every new sun,<br/>
      a journey does begin.<br/>
      Offers happiness or cry,<br/>
      Seems doesn't worth a try.<br/>
      With each sinking sun,<br/>
      a searching does begin.<br/>
      One looking for a bed,<br/>
      Becoming the dead.
